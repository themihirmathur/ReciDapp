Food waste is a significant problem since people sometimes find it difficult to find new uses for leftover food. ReciDapp takes care of this problem by utilizing a simple, straightforward method that makes it easier to make the most use of leftover food. Our system uses sustainable techniques and sophisticated algorithms to provide personalized recipe recommendations based on the user's ingredient availability. This helps people make the most of their financial resources and actively promotes a more environmentally responsible way of living in addition to reducing food waste.
